OnePlus One Stock Rom Flasher (64GB)

Easily, it's a bash script I edited to flash my OnePlus One(64GB) back to stock.

Just copy the script in the stock rom (fastboot signed) folder and open a terminal inside.

First of all, gain root access with sudo -s, sudo su, or simply, su.

Then, chmod +x flasher_64.sh and ./flasher_64.sh.

When the flashing process will be completed, the script will display it.

Enjoy :)
